#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND LENGTH(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderid
WHERE LENGTH(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(Quantity), product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales 
LEFT JOIN customers 
ON FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND LENGTH(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product
